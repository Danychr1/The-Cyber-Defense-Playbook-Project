# SOC Core Skills 
## Course Background and Objectives
- The SOC Core Skills course evolved from an "Intro to Security" class, which itself grew out of a "deception class" taught at Wild West Hackingfest
- The course was created to address the need for foundational security skills, as many existing courses assumed prior knowledge of Linux, command-line interfaces, and packet captures
- It aims to establish core skills in Windows, Windows command line, TCP/IP, packet analysis, Wireshark, and network threat hunting, providing a foundation for other Anti-Siphon courses.
- All Anti-Siphon instructors are former SANS instructors, seniors, and fellows, offering high-quality training through a "pay-what-you-can" model to give back to the community.
## Pedagogical Approach and Incident Response Mindset
- The course emphasizes a "don't panic" approach to incident handling, drawing an analogy to military weapons training where skills are drilled repeatedly in worst-case scenarios until they become second nature.
- This repetitive drilling of fundamental skills helps analysts relax during incidents and prevents paralysis.
- The entire course is taught through the "lens of compromise," focusing on how to find malware and analyze network traffic after a system has been popped, rather than dry theoretical instruction.
- This approach also builds a foundation for incident response classes.
While plans can be useless once an incident unfolds, the planning process itself is indispensable.
- The course promotes dealing with complexity through "Legos of functionality," where core skills are seen as building blocks to tackle any attack scenario. 
- These "Legos" include crisis management, network threat hunting, memory analysis, endpoint analysis, UEBA, log review, and endpoint protection analysis.

  Here is a flowchart illustrating the "Legos of Functionality" concept for incident response:
